Explain the concepts and characteristics of routing and switching.

• Properties of network traffic
  - Broadcast domains
  - CSMA/CD
  - CSMA/CA
  - Collision domains
  - Protocol data units
  - MTU
  - Broadcast
  - Multicast
  - Unicast
• Segmentation and interface properties
  - VLANs
  - Trunking (802.1q)
  - Tagging and untagging ports
  - Port mirroring
  - Switching loops/spanning tree
  - PoE and PoE+ (802.3af, 802.3at)
  - DMZ
  - MAC address table
  - ARP table
• Routing
  - Routing protocols (IPv4 and IPv6)
     - Distance-vector routing protocols
     - RIP
     - EIGRP
     - Link-state routing protocols
     - OSPF
     - Hybrid
 - BGP
  - Routing types
     - Static
     - Dynamic
     - Default
• IPv6 concepts
  - Addressing
  - Tunneling
  - Dual stack
  - Router advertisement
  - Neighbor discovery
• Performance concepts
  - Traffic shaping
  - QoS
  - Diffserv
  - CoS
• NAT/PAT
• Port forwarding
• Access control list
• Distributed switching
• Packet-switched vs. circuit-switched network
• Software-defined networking
