Explain the network troubleshooting methodology.

• Identify the problem
   - Gather information
   - Duplicate the problem, if possible
   - Question users
   - Identify symptoms
   - Determine if anything has changed
   - Approach multiple problems individually
• Establish a theory of probable cause
   - Question the obvious
   - Consider multiple approaches
   - Top-to-bottom/bottom-to-top
 OSI model
   - Divide and conquer
• Test the theory to determine the cause
  - Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem
  - If the theory is not confirmed, reestablish a new theory or escalate
• Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects
• Implement the solution or escalate as necessary
• Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
• Document findings, actions, and outcomes
