# Whitespace Study Workspace
A repository designed for group studying for the whitespace discord server.

## Topics Covered
- CompTIA Network+ (N10-007)
- CompTIA Security+ (SY0-501)
- OSINT Framework (https://inteltechniques.com)
- Elastic Stack (https://www.elastic.co/learn)

## What This is NOT
- A study program
- A repository for cheating
- A walk in the park
- For those not part of the whitespace server

This repository will be updated on a weekly basis by myself as I progress through my study routine. If you would like to add notes, tips, resources for studying/practicing, etc, please either message me in the discord server, or directly (@meta).
